# FastAPI LLM RAG Backend Application

## Overview
This project is a FastAPI backend application that implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model using a Large Language Model (LLM). The application is designed to provide intelligent responses by combining the capabilities of LLMs with a retrieval mechanism to fetch relevant information from a knowledge base.

## Features
- FastAPI framework for building APIs quickly and efficiently.
- Integration with a Large Language Model for natural language understanding and generation.
- Retrieval mechanism to fetch relevant documents or data to enhance responses.
- Easy to deploy and scale.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn
- Any LLM library (e.g., Hugging Face Transformers)
- A retrieval system (e.g., Elasticsearch, Pinecone)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/llm-rag-fastapi.git
   cd llm-rag-fastapi
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Start the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

2. Access the API documentation at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

## API Endpoints
- `POST /generate`: Generates a response based on the input query.
- `GET /health`: Checks the health status of the application.
